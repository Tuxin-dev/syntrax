Syntrax
=======

Syntrax is a railroad diagram generator. It creates visual illustration of the grammar used for programming languages.


Requirements
------------

Syntrax requires either Python 2.7 or Python 3.x, pycairo, and pango.

The installation script depends on setuptools which will be installed if it
isn't currently present in your Python distribution. The source is written in
Python 2.7 syntax but will convert cleanly to Python 3 when the installer
passes it through 2to3.


Download
--------

You can access the Syntrax Git repository from `Github
<https://github.com/kevinpt/syntrax>`_. You can install direct from PyPI with the "pip"
command if you have it available.


Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is available online at the `main Syntrax site
<http://kevinpt.github.io/syntrax/>`_.
